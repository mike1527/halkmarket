The EOS 5D is\r\n unlike any previous digital SLR in that it combines a full-frame (35 mm\r\n sized) high resolution sensor (12.8 megapixels) with a relatively \r\ncompact body (slightly larger than the EOS 20D, although in your hand it\r\n feels noticeably 'chunkier'). The EOS 5D is aimed to slot in between \r\nthe EOS 20D and the EOS-1D professional digital SLR's, an important \r\ndifference when compared to the latter is that the EOS 5D doesn't have \r\nany environmental seals. While Canon don't specifically refer to the EOS\r\n 5D as a 'professional' digital SLR it will have obvious appeal to \r\nprofessionals who want a high quality digital SLR in a body lighter than\r\n the EOS-1D. It will also no doubt appeal to current EOS 20D owners \r\n(although lets hope they've not bought too many EF-S lenses...) \u00e4\u00eb&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;","meta_title":"","noindex":"1","meta_h1":"","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":"","tag":"","model":"Test","sku":"","upc":"","ean":"","jan":"","isbn":"","mpn":"","location":"","quantity":"6","stock_status":"2-3 Days","image":"catalog\/demo\/canon_eos_5d_1.jpg","manufacturer_id":"9","manufacturer":"Nivea","price":"100.0000","special":"80.0000","reward":"200","points":"0","tax_class_id":"9","date_available":"2009-02-03","weight":"0.00000000","weight_class_id":"1","length":"0.00000000","width":"0.00000000","height":"0.00000000","length_class_id":"1","subtract":"1","rating":0,"reviews":0,"minimum":"1","sort_order":"0","status":"1","date_added":"2009-02-03 16:59:00","date_modified":"2020-12-24 22:38:39","viewed":"630"},"47":{"product_id":"47","name":"HP LP3065","description":"&lt;p&gt;Stop your co-workers in their tracks with the stunning new 30-inch \r\ndiagonal HP LP3065 Flat Panel Monitor.
